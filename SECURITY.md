## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue, please follow these steps:

### 1. Do NOT Open a Public Issue

Please **do not** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities. This could put users at risk.

### 2. Report Privately

Send an email to: **[security@nexus-project.com]** (or project maintainer email)

Include:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if any)

### 3. Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 1 week
- **Fix Timeline**: Depends on severity (see below)
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is released

### 4. Severity Levels

| Severity | Description | Response Time |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| **Critical** | Remote code execution, authentication bypass | 24-48 hours |
| **High** | Privilege escalation, data exposure | 1 week |
| **Medium** | DoS, information disclosure | 2 weeks |
| **Low** | Minor issues with limited impact | 1 month |

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Never commit secrets**
   - Use `.env` files (in `.gitignore`)
   - Use environment variables
   - Never hardcode credentials

2. **Keep dependencies updated**
   ```bash
   npm audit
   npm audit fix
   npm update
   ```

3. **Use security linters**
   ```bash
   npm run lint:security
   ```

4. **Follow secure coding guidelines**
   - Validate all inputs
   - Sanitize user data
   - Use parameterized queries
   - Implement proper authentication/authorization

### For Deployment

1. **Environment Variables**
   - Use strong, unique secrets
   - Rotate secrets regularly
   - Never use default values

2. **HTTPS/TLS**
   - Always use HTTPS in production
   - Use valid TLS certificates
   - Enforce TLS 1.2 or higher

3. **Database Security**
   - Use strong passwords
   - Enable authentication
   - Restrict network access
   - Enable audit logging

4. **Redis Security**
   - Set a strong password
   - Bind to localhost or private network
   - Disable dangerous commands

5. **Rate Limiting**
   - Enable rate limiting on all endpoints
   - Stricter limits on authentication endpoints

6. **Monitoring**
   - Enable logging
   - Monitor for suspicious activity
   - Set up alerts for anomalies

## Security Features

### Authentication

- JWT-based authentication
- Refresh token rotation
- Token expiration (15 minutes for access, 7 days for refresh)
- Secure cookie storage (httpOnly, secure in production)

### Password Security

- bcrypt hashing (10 rounds)
- Minimum 8 characters
- Complexity requirements
- Password history (prevents reuse)

### Input Validation

- Zod schema validation
- MongoDB sanitization (prevent NoSQL injection)
- XSS prevention
- CSRF protection (when enabled)

### Rate Limiting

- General endpoints: 100 requests/15 minutes
- Auth endpoints: 5 requests/15 minutes
- Redis-backed (distributed rate limiting)

### Security Headers

Using Helmet.js for security headers:
- X-Frame-Options
- X-Content-Type-Options
- Strict-Transport-Security
- Content-Security-Policy

## Known Security Considerations

### 1. JWT Token Storage

**Current Implementation:**
- Tokens stored in httpOnly cookies
- Accessible via Authorization header

**Considerations:**
- Cookies are vulnerable to CSRF (mitigation: CSRF tokens)
- LocalStorage is vulnerable to XSS (not used)
- Current approach balances security and usability

### 2. Token Refresh

**Current Implementation:**
- Refresh tokens stored in database
- Single-use refresh tokens (rotation)

**Considerations:**
- Refresh token theft allows long-term access
- Mitigation: Detect token reuse, revoke all tokens

### 3. OTP Security

**Current Implementation:**
- 6-digit numeric code
- 5-minute expiration
- Stored in Redis with encryption

**Considerations:**
- Vulnerable to brute force (partially mitigated by rate limiting)
- Consider: SMS/Email delivery security

### 4. LinkedIn OAuth

**Current Implementation:**
- State parameter for CSRF protection
- Token exchange on backend

**Considerations:**
- Relies on LinkedIn's security
- Validate all responses from LinkedIn
